title: Learning local substitutable context-free languages from positive examples
  in polynomial time and data by reduction
abstract: To study more formally the approach by reduction initiated by ReGLiS, we
  propose a formal characterization of the grammars in reduced normal form (RNF) which
  can be learned by this approach. A modification of the core of ReGLiS is then proposed
  to ensure returning RNF grammars in polynomial time. This enables us to show that
  local substitutable languages represented by RNF context-free grammars are identifiable
  in polynomial time and thick data (IPTtD) from positive examples.
