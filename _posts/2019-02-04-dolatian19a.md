title: Learning reduplication with 2-way finite-state transducers
abstract: Reduplication is a cross-linguistically common and productive word-formation
  mechanism. However, there are little to no learning results concerning it. This
  is partly due to the high computational complexity associated with copying, which
  often goes beyond standard finite-state technology and partly due to the absence
  of concrete computational models of reduplicative processes. We show here that reduplication
  can be modeled accurately and succinctly with 2-way finite-state transducers. Based
  on this finite-state representation, we identify a subclass of 2-way FSTs based
  on copying and Output Strictly Local functions. These so-called Concatenated Output
  Strictly Local functions (C-OSL) can model the majority of attested reduplicative
  processes we have surveyed. We introduce a simple extension to the inference algorithm
  for OSL functions that trivially leads to a provably correct learning result for
  C-OSL functions under the assumption that function concatenation is overtly marked.
