title: Inferring DFA without Negative Examples
abstract: The inference of a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) without negative
  examples is one of the most natural inference problems. On the other hand, it is
  well known that DFA cannot be identified in the limit from positive examples only.
  We propose two modifications of this problem to make it solvable, i.e., identifiable
  in the limit, while remaining rather close to the original problem. First, we propose
  to use the inclusion of languages to reason about complexity and infer the simplest
  solution. Second, we set the maximum number of states for the inferred DFA. These
  changes bring new means to control the solution space. While the language inclusion
  allows us to choose a simplest solution among possible solutions, the maximum number
  of states determines the degree of approximation. We propose an efficient inference
  method based on the incremental use of a SAT solver and demonstrate on a practical
  example the relevance of our approach.
