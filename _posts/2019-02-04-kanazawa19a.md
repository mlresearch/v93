title: Decision problems for Clark-congruential languages
abstract: A common question when studying a class of context-free grammars (CFGs)
  is whether equivalence is decidable within this class. We answer this question positively
  for the class of <em>Clark-congruential grammars</em>, which are of interest to
  grammatical inference. We also consider the problem of checking whether a given
  CFG is Clark-congruential, and show that it is decidable given that the CFG is a
  deterministic CFG.
