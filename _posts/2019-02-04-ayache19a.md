title: Explaining Black Boxes on Sequential Data using Weighted Automata
abstract: 'Understanding how a learned black box works is of crucial interest for
  the future of Machine Learning. In this paper, we pioneer the question of the global
  interpretability of learned black box models that assign numerical values to symbolic
  sequential data. To tackle that task, we propose a spectral algorithm for the extraction
  of weighted automata (WA) from such black boxes. This algorithm does not require
  the access to a dataset or to the inner representation of the black box: the inferred
  model can be obtained solely by querying the black box, feeding it with inputs and
  analyzing its outputs. Experiments using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) trained
  on a wide collection of 48 synthetic datasets and 2 real datasets show that the
  obtained approximation is of great quality.'
