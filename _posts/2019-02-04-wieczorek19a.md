title: Suffix Classification Trees
abstract: 'In this paper, a new method for generating acyclic word graph is proposed.
  The essential characteristics of the method are: the construction of the data structure
  in linear time with respect to the size of an input and gathering factor frequencies.
  Moreover, it has been shown through a computational experiment that the proposed
  approach surpasses—with respect to AUC score—similar grammatical inference algorithms
  on the sequences from a real biological dataset.'
