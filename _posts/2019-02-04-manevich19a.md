title: Inferring Program Extensions from Traces
abstract: We present an algorithm for learning a non-trivial class of imperative programs.
  The algorithm accepts positive traces—input stores followed by a sequence of commands—and
  returns a program that <em>extends</em> the target program. That is, it behaves
  the same as the target program on all valid inputs—inputs for which the target program
  successfully terminates, and may behave arbitrarily on other inputs. Our algorithm
  is based on a quotient construction of the control flow graph of the target program.
  Since not all programs have a quotient in a convenient form, the ability to infer
  an extension of the target program increases the class of inferred programs. We
  have implemented our algorithm and applied it successfully to learn a variety of
  programs that operate over linked data structures and integer arithmetic.
