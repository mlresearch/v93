title: Using Adaptive Sequences for Learning Non-Resettable FSMs
abstract: This paper proposes a new method to infer non-resettable Mealy machines
  based on the notions of adaptive homing and characterizing used in FSM testing.
  This method does not require any knowledge on the system inferred apart from its
  input set. It progressively extends an output query, and also avoids almost all
  equivalence queries. It is fast, and scales to machines that have hundreds of states.
  It outperforms in most respect previous algorithms, and can even compete with algorithms
  that assume a reset.
