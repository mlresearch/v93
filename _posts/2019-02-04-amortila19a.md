title: Learning Graph Weighted Models on Pictures
abstract: Graph Weighted Models (GWMs) have recently been proposed as a natural generalization
  of weighted automata over strings and trees to arbitrary families of labeled graphs
  (and hypergraphs). A GWM generically associates a labeled graph with a tensor network
  and computes a value by successive contractions directed by its edges. In this paper,
  we consider the problem of learning GWMs defined over the graph family of pictures
  (or 2-dimensional words). As a proof of concept, we consider regression and classification
  tasks over the simple <em>Bars & Stripes</em> and <em>Shifting Bits</em> picture
  languages and provide an experimental study investigating whether these languages
  can be learned in the form of a GWM from positive and negative examples using gradient-based
  methods. Our results suggest that this is indeed possible and that investigating
  the use of gradient-based methods to learn picture series and functions computed
  by GWMs over other families of graphs could be a fruitful direction.
