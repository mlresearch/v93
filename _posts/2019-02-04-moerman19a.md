title: Learning Product Automata
abstract: We give an optimisation for active learning algorithms, applicable to learning
  Moore machines with decomposable outputs. These machines can be decomposed themselves
  by projecting on each output. This results in smaller components that can then be
  learnt with fewer queries. We give experimental evidence that this is a useful technique
  which can reduce the number of queries substantially. Only in some cases the performance
  is worsened by the slight overhead. Compositional methods are widely used throughout
  engineering, and the decomposition presented in this article promises to be particularly
  interesting for learning hardware systems.
