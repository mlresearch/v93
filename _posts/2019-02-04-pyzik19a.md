title: How to measure the topological quality of protein parse trees?
abstract: Human readability and, consequently, interpretability is often considered
  a key advantage of grammatical descriptors. Beyond the natural language, this is
  also true in analyzing biological sequences of RNA, typically modeled by grammars
  of at least context-free level of expressiveness. However, in protein sequence analysis,
  the explanatory power of grammatical descriptors beyond regular has never been thoroughly
  assessed. Since the biological meaning of a protein molecule is directly related
  to its spatial structure, it is justified to expect that the parse tree of a protein
  sequence reflects the spatial structure of the protein. In this piece of research,
  we propose and assess quantitative measures for comparing topology of the parse
  tree of a context-free grammar with topology of the protein structure succinctly
  represented by a contact map. Our results are potentially interesting beyond its
  bioinformatic context wherever a reference matrix of dependencies between sequence
  constituents is available.
